Description: Mass SNMP scanner
 Braa is a mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course
 making SNMP queries - but unlike snmpget or snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able
 to query dozens or hundreds of hosts simultaneously, and in a single process.
 Thus, it consumes very few system resources and does the scanning VERY fast.
 .
 Braa implements its OWN snmp stack, so it does NOT need any SNMP libraries
 like net-snmp. The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data
 types, and in any case cannot be stated 'standard-conforming'! It was designed
 to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of author
 laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa - the user HAVE to know the
 numerical values of OID's
 (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0).
